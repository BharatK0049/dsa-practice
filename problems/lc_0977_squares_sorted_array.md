# Problem: Squares of a Sorted Array
LeetCode #977

## Pattern
(What pattern does this belong to?)

## Problem Restatement
Given a sorted array, return the array with its elements squared.

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- Naturally when there are negative elements present, squaring them might make them bigger and the array won't be sorted
- The brute force method is to square them first, which is already O(n) and then sort it, which if optimal is still O(nlogn)
- There has to be an in place method that does it in O(n)
