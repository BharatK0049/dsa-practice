# Problem: Is Subsequence
LeetCode #392

## Pattern
(What pattern does this belong to?)

## Problem Restatement
Given a string and a smaller string, check if the letters in the smaller string occur in the same order in the bigger string (doesn't have to be adjacent)

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- using in operator won't work as it just checks if the letter exists.
- However, we can filter out subsequences that don't exist by checking if the characters aren't in the string to begin with
- Maybe I can use a set and a list to just get hold of the letters that exist in the bigger string and check if the letters in the list has the same size as the small string
- 

## Failed Attempts / Confusions
- Using a list to get hold of indices does not work well when the letters do exist but not in the same order. 

## Final Approach (In Words)
- 

## Code
