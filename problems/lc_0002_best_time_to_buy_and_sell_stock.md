# Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
LeetCode # 121

## Pattern
(What pattern does this belong to?)

## Problem Restatement
I am given an array whose each element represents the value of a stock. I am supposed to find out the maximum profit from the day I buy to the day I sell in the future. return 0 if profit is not found.

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- I must move from left to right. For finding an element, there has to be at least a value to its right that must be greater than the given number. 
- If the numbers are in descending order, there exists no profit. There must be some way to keep in mind the previous things kept in mind.
- Reminds me a lot of the Coin change problem and most dynamic programming problems.
