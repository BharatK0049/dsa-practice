# Problem: Merge Sorted Array
LeetCode #88

## Pattern
Two-Pointers

## Problem Restatement
(Explain the problem in your own words)

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- I can just remove the last n digits from the first array, then use a temporary array to add both the arrays and then use a sort() function to get the job done
- And then I just copy it back to the original array. 

## Failed Attempts / Confusions
- Brute force - O(n^2): Remove the unnecessary elements in the first array, then adding the two arrays in a temporary array and sorting the array on top
- Really can't figure out which pattern this falls under.

## Final Approach (In Words)
- 

## Code
```python
# write final code here
```
