# Problem: Valid Palindrome
LeetCode #125

## Pattern
Two pointers

## Problem Restatement
Check and see if a word when reversed is the same word as the original one. This is when all capital letters are made lowercase.
All special characters, spaces, numbers are not to be considered. Just see if the letters are repeatable reverse

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- Use functions like strip to get rid of spacing,
- Use a list to append all letters and to see when reversed if the letters match the same sequence
- Use a flag to see if I can check till when the letter is not the same

## Failed Attempts / Confusions
- Got optimal solution but used extra memory.

## Final Approach (In Words)
- 

## Code
```python
