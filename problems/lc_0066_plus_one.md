# Problem:
LeetCode #66

## Pattern
(What pattern does this belong to?)

## Problem Restatement
I have an array which represents digits of a number. I am to return an array with digits but the number should be incremented by one. 
Like the units digit must be increased by one.

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- Can it be done in O(1)? Just see if the last digit is <9, then just add one to the last element and return list. 
- If element is 9, then one of two things can happen, either there is a pre-existing number out there and I can just add 1 to the number before it and make the 9 a 0, or I add a 1 to the left of the nine and make the 9 a 0
