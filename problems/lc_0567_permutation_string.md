# Problem:
LeetCode #567

## Pattern
(What pattern does this belong to?)

## Problem Restatement
Given a string and a substring, check if the substring has at least a permutation of it in the string.

## Initial Thoughts (Before Coding)
- Okay, so clearly, it's not asking to look for the letters in the string, nor is it asking if the exact substring exists in that string.
- The brute force for this would be to use a helper function to generate all possible permutations of this substring and see if that substring exists in the string.
