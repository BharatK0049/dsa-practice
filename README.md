# DSA Practice — Pattern-First Learning

This repository tracks my **deliberate practice** of Data Structures and Algorithms for technical interviews.

The goal is **not** to collect solutions.
The goal is to **internalize problem-solving patterns** and be able to reproduce solutions under interview constraints.

## Rules of Engagement (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No solution videos or editorials for the first 30 minutes**
2. **Approach must be written in words before code**
3. **Every problem must be mapped to a pattern**
4. **If I cannot explain the solution aloud, the problem does not count**
5. **Review > Volume**

Violating any rule invalidates the problem.

## Problem Workflow

For every problem:

1. Read problem and restate it in my own words
2. Identify likely pattern(s)
3. Write approach in plain English
4. Attempt solution (30 minutes minimum)
5. Only then consult references (if needed)
6. Rewrite final solution from scratch
7. Record key insight and mistake

Each problem lives as a **markdown file**, not just code.

---

## Problem Template

Each problem file must include:

- Problem statement (short)
- Pattern used
- Initial thoughts (before coding)
- Failed attempts / confusion
- Final approach (in words)
- Final code
- One-line takeaway

If any section is missing, the problem is incomplete.

## Patterns I Am Tracking

Patterns are first-class citizens.

Examples:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search on Answer
- DFS / BFS
- Dynamic Programming (1D / 2D)

Patterns are documented in `/patterns`.

---

## Review Strategy

- Revisit problems after:
  - 3 days
  - 1 week
  - 1 month
- Focus on:
  - Re-deriving the approach
  - Not re-reading the code

---

## Metrics That Matter

- Can I solve without hints?
- Can I explain the approach aloud?
- Do I recognize the pattern quickly?
- Time to first correct idea

Raw problem count is irrelevant.

---

## Current Focus

- Build intuition
- Reduce panic under time pressure
- Think in patterns, not syntax
