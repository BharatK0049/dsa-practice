# Sliding Window Pattern

## When to Suspect It
- Contiguous subarray or substring
- Asked for longest / shortest / count
- Optimization over a range

## Core Idea
Maintain a window that expands and shrinks while preserving a condition.

## Key Decisions
- Fixed window or variable window?
- What breaks the condition?
- What moves the left pointer?

## Common Mistakes
- Updating answer before shrinking
- Forgetting to update frequency map

## Canonical Problems
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Minimum Window Substring
- Permutation in String
