## Week 1 — Reflections

### What I Learned
- Patterns are not just data structures like “hashmap” or “two pointers,” but invariants that explain why a solution avoids brute force.
- Many problems that look different on the surface reduce to a small set of recurring ideas such as complement lookup, frequency cancellation, sequence start detection, or backward merging.
- Understanding why a solution works is more important than being able to reproduce it quickly.

### What Tripped Me
- Problems with non-obvious invariants (e.g., Group Anagrams, Plus One, Squares of a Sorted Array) where I could recognize the general direction but could not derive the exact logic without seeing the solution.
- I often defaulted to familiar patterns (like two pointers) even when the underlying invariant didn’t justify them.
- I spent a lot of time on individual problems, sometimes exhausting myself before exploring alternative ways of reasoning.

### Patterns Added
- Two pointers (forward, backward, and slow–fast variants)
- Hashmap Frequency / Existence Checking
- Prefix-based Techniques (prefix sum / prefix state)

### Problems I Can Now Solve Blind
- Two Sum
- Best time to buy and sell stock
- group anagrams
- minimum in sorted array
- maximum subarray
